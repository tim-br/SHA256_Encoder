To compile and run this program, compile the Gui.java program in the src/main_package directory. Then run the program with 'java Gui'.

This program was written in java 8 with javafx, so be sure to compile it with java8.

I am getting errors when I compile on different computers and I haven't ironed all of them out yet. I will soon.
